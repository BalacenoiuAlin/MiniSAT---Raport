Quick Install

- Decide where to install the files . The simplest approach is to use
  GNU standard locations and just set a "prefix" for the root install
  directory (reffered to as $PREFIX below). More control can be
  achieved by overriding other of the GNU standard install locations
  (includedir, bindir, etc). Configuring with just a prefix:

  > make config prefix=$PREFIX

- Compiling and installing:

  > make install

================================================================================
Configuration

- Multiple configuration steps can be joined into one call to "make
  config" by appending multiple variable assignments on the same line.

- The configuration is stored in the file "config.mk". Look here if
  you want to know what the current configuration looks like.

- To reset from defaults simply remove the "config.mk" file or call
  "make distclean".

- Recompilation can be done without the configuration step.

# Modified for University project purposes section

Commit 1:
Until now, there has been no modification of the original code. However 
for university project purposes, we added a new file named "SUBLICENSE.txt". 
This file serves as an additional resource for handling sublicenses within the project.

Commit 2:

The propagate function is restructured for better maintainability and readability, the logic of the function
has been breaked dowin into smaller functions named "helper", each helper function is handling a specific responsability.
This reduces complexity, makes the code modular and simplifies future updates.

Commit 2:

Modified toDimacs() for better maintainability. The initial function is now broken down into smaller functions that work together to achieve the same functionality. Each helper function has a specific responsibility, ensuring the code is more modular, readable, and easier to update in the future.
